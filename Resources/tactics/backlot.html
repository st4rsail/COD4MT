Type of Combat: Close-quarters with some medium and long range combat</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Backlot is a mid-sized map that is good for almost all game modes. There are two M249 mounted machine guns. However, there are several spots to counter this.</p>

<p>The top of the middle building is great for snipers or heavy gunners. But do not dwell on the second floor for long, because if done so, the player is easy prey for the machine guns, both of which can hit the whole second floor. Also be careful of enemies using the dumpster below one of the windows to climb inside. By climbing out another of these windows, players can also quickly press the action button in order to climb into a small wooden ledge. From there they can hide inside to pick off enemies, or climb the ladder in order to reach the top floor of the middle building. Be careful when up here as it is quite easy to encounter a grenade thrown by the enemy.</p>

<p>If the "Flawless" challenge is needed, a good chance to get it is to go in the basement of the construction building, it is a very overlooked area. The aid of UAV Jammer is advised when doing this. All types of classes are effective on this map.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>The mounted machine guns are useful for taking out enemy helicopters but can attract the attention of enemy snipers.</p>

<p>The construction site and building on the opposite side are often used by snipers and there are often claymores on/next the stairs on either building.</p>

<p>The tall two story building in the middle of the map can be accessed via two of the windows on the second floor and also it is possible to reach the roof of this building.</p>

<p>In Domination, it is easiest to control A and C by running back and forth through the construction building as the majority of the fighting tends to be over B and usually everyone is too busy camping or capping it to care that you're taking the other 2.</p>

<p>Don't camp in the 2 story little building with the turret by A. You can be seen through much of the map and it only takes a well aimed Deep Impact gun to shoot you through the wall. Plus, you're not helping to win the game.</p>

<p>Silencers are your best friend on this map. There are so many places to be shot from behind that not appearing on the radar when you fire is super helpful in prolonging your life. Plus, you probably won't be doing too much long distance fighting so the Red Dot or ACOG is unnecessary.</p>
