<h1>Countdown</h1>

<img src="../images/thumbnails/countdown.png" />

<p>Teams: S.A.S. vs. Spetsnaz<br />
Place: Altai Mountains, Russia<br />
Terrain: A missile launch range with hangers on both sides of the map which leaves the rest of the map to be somewhat wide open<br />
Type of Combat: Long to medium range combat</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The design of the map features missile silos, small hangars (2 on each side of the map, rather close to each other), blast shields that offer some cover, and tank trucks to climb. Intense battles usually occur on this map. This is evident on gametypes such as Headquarters, Sabotage and Domination. LMGs and Assault Rifles seem to be preferred on this map, with Digital camouflage as well. In spite of the largely flat layout, the Goodbye  challenge (killing yourself by falling 30 feet to your death) can be easily achieved by falling down into one of the uncovered missile silos that previously held an ICBM. Players that enjoy more confined, enclosed combat tend to dislike this map due to its large flat layout.</p>

<p>Sniping is a good strategy but do not plan on "setting up camp", as the shifts between sides of the field occur very often and the numerous visual obstacles (smoke, silo covers, etc) allow opponents with cover - making ambush a high possibility. Find the fight, get one or two kills, then move on.</p>

<p>Stuns and Frags are very useful on this map, as all 4 warehouses are favorite hiding places for campers, behind crates or missile racks, in most game modes. Throwing grenades before entering the warehouse will often result in easy kills. Many sniper spots are available, spots to be noted are the top of missile and the tops of trucks.Other sniper spots to be considered are the containers north of the downed helicopter and between the warehouses.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>With both sides of the map, an opposing team member could easily flank.</p>

<p>Climbing onto silo covers, missiles, and trucks provides advantageous vantage points. Though, be aware you become an easy target.</p>

<p>In Domination, try to hold A and B and maintain pressure up the open left side of the map as it's easier to spot people approaching than it is on the covered area near C and the fallen chopper</p>

<p>The short metal dumpsters make excellent cover as most people will stop in their tracks and try to line up a headshot while you mow them down. To counter the player in this position, use deep impact and shoot at their body through the dumpster. This is easier than aiming for the head and allows you to move and deke while shooting.</p>

<p>This is another map where smokes are a huge help in crossing the open areas.</p>
