<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Shipment is a small map ideal for quick and short games, like Free For All, in Call of Duty 4. Cage Matches are great on this map. When playing this map, most players will arm themselves with shotguns or SMGs, in particular the P90, due to it's high rate of fire, and the MP5. Assault Rifles are also used to great effect due to the medium-range fighting that can occur, and LMGs are used to shoot through shipping containers or get many spray kills. The only guns that do not excel here are snipers, unless you like to quickscope. Throwing a grenade at anytime during any game usually results in a kill and a well placed airstrike can kill everyone on the opposing team. Spawn Killing is a big problem on matches with a large number of players, especially on Free-for-All mode. In this map, the player needs to have a quick mind because enemies are everywhere. Smart players can excel here, as knowledge of hiding/killing spots can achieve very quick kill streaks, without being exposed. If playing on Old School mode, the player can get on top of the containers. From there, most places on the map can be seen.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Using silenced weapons is thought to be a good strategy, but the benefits are generally outweighed by the fact that the player will be visually located by enemies fairly easily regardless if using a silencer or not.</p>

<p>There is a way to easily reach high kill streaks and get maximized kills. In the center of the map, there are 4 pairs of shipping containers. One of the containers is open. Go inside this container and go prone behind the second barrel facing at an angle towards the player's left, so the map is visible. With a little bit of patience, people will walk by and a shotgun will eradicate of them. The player can also aim cross-map from here, past the path in between the two pairs of containers. Being spotted is somewhat of a problem, but C4 or Claymore can usually do the trick. The player's location is usually familiarized by another smart player.</p>

<p>If having trouble with other players using the previous strategy, try lobbing a stun or frag grenade inside the container.</p>

<p>When playing a match, cook a frag for 2 seconds and throw, the result is almost a 100% garranteed kill.</p>

<p>When playing a match if the player spawns next to an open storage container, try to run in quickly as grenades may fly into the immediate area. This happens often in search and destroy as there is no respawning.</p>

<p>It is advised to use the P90 or LMG's as they have reasonably large magazines, and this is crucial because there are very few places on the map that are safe.</p>

<p>In old school mode, try to hide in a container near a weapon/perk and when people walk by to get it, the player has an easy shot.</p>
