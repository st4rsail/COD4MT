<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Map set around a convoy of broken-down vehicles and hosts a wide variety of elevated spots, enabling you to hold your breath and take aim. Both spawn points provide ample sniping locations which overlook the middle of the map, along with the opposing sniper positions. The sewer tunnels are an area of the map which are most largely overlooked. This is a small area, but one that has saved lives on more than one occasion, especially by protecting players from the bombs of airstrikes. This map is also known for spam grenading (throwing a random grenade anywhere and getting a kill). All types of classes are effective here. Desert camouflage or Digital camouflage  work best. By jumping onto certain points and objects, players are allowed to get into destroyed buildings that are otherwise inaccessible.</p>

<p>Stealth classes work particularly well here, as the map offers a lot of cover, dark corners and high grass. In addition, many of the buildings encourage camping. Getting up behind people is a good way to get headshots. Be warned though: On team deathmatch, the spawn locations swap sides frequently, meaning the player may end up in the middle of their own spawn point. Additionally, claymores and C4 are frequently used, so Bomb Squad is particularly useful, especially if the aforementioned stealth class is used. </p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>The tunnels under the center of the map can be used to flank enemies taking point B in Domination, and players in the middle in general.</p>

<p>The turret near USMC spawn can be used when on defense but enemies will usually return once they know the player's position.</p>

<p>Snipers often lurk on the first story roof tops of the buildings on either side of the road.</p>

<p>From the second story building on the east side of the map, one can get a good sniper view of their east pathway.</p>

<p>A good team can establish excellent fire lanes, but it requires coordination, and team members must cover the rear area to prevent flanking.</p>

<p>All weapons, although one must take extra precautions when using a shotgun, can be effective on this map if the user flanks and stays out of the open. It is recommended using Extreme Conditioning to get through open areas fast. Use the tunnels in the center of the map to avoid being caught out in the open. If the player stays around the outer areas of the map, they can easily spawn kill. Snipers must take particular care to keep moving, as most players often scan the 4 main elevated buildings.</p>

<p>Some buildings on the OpFor spawn side of the map can be hopped into.</p>

<p>If one of the sewer pipes is frequently being used by the enemy the other one can be used as an effective gunning post as there are two smaller barred pipes connecting the sewers and they can be shot through, but plant Claymores at both ends of the tunnel because it is very likely the player will be surrounded.</p>

<p>On Domination, one can easily defend flags A or C using the nearby mounted M249s</p>

<p>If the player spawns as a member the USMC on this map they are more likely to be spawn trapped at their beginning spawn point.</p>
