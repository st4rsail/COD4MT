<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The map is a very wide open and set in a junk-filled Middle-Eastern field. There are four regions on the map. The first is the swampy northeastern section of the map. Although it appears to be wide open with little or no cover, the tank, the tall grasses, and the random bits of junk are surprisingly effective at concealing a soldier. The "Hamburger Hill" can be used to snipe towards the other side of the map. The next area is the middle building. It houses bomb plant point A in Search and Destroy. Anyone on the west side of this building has a good shot in, and claymores  are very effective for preventing anyone from coming in. The third region is the corner building in the southwest corner of the map. It is the spawn area for defenders in Search and Destroy, and has excellent sight lines towards the east. The pile of small boxes on the northern edge of this building can be an excellent sniping spot. The final region is the western half of the open area. It features several large shipping crates and a bus for cover. A patient, unmoving sniper can be concealed surprisingly well in the back corner of this section. A good tactic is to plant claymores in the left building because there are stacks of people that rush the area.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Use Deep Impact. An RPD w/Red Dot, Stopping Power and Deep Impact is the best way to eliminate snipers camping behind the various cover around the map. Deep Impact is particularily helpful for clearing out the bus, shooting snipers way across the map in the "market" area, eliminating players in the fenced area to the left of A, and through the walls right in front of A where many people will camp.</p>

<p>Use smoke. Friendly snipers camping in the back might not appreciate it but smoke is really the only way to get across the map sometimes. Throw them as far as possible towards the other team once having spawned, it really truly helps.</p>

<p>A simple but rarely used tactic is to enter the broken bus on the west side. This tactic is a great way to snipe some players on the enemies side of the map. Always stay alert if in the bus by crouching down and having a quick look outside the broken windows of the bus. It is very easy for enemies to eliminate the player if he/she is not paying attention. If the player can see enemy soldiers about to come on the bus, attempt to knife this enemy and leave the area. If the player uses this tactic, any bolt-action snipers are recommended. They are effective because most people would shoot an M21 or a Dragunov like a semi-automatic rifle, this will give the player's location away. Another tactic to use in order to stop enemies from entering the bus is to equip claymores on a sniper class. If one places a claymore near a corner of the bus, or in one of the doorways it will likely stop them from entering the bus and stopping one's killstreak.</p>

<p>A good idea is to use a sniper rifle by the east side of the map, behind the walls. Aiming at the building entrance on the left side of the player's view (South on the map), where a lot of enemies go in and out and around, using an M21 is a good idea because the area is usually crowded. The M21 can quickly fire more bullets, unlike other sniper rifles.</p>

<p>If the player spawns as the Marines, it is also good to snipe at the spawning point. As firefights usually take place in the buildings and in the middle of the map, however, if the player is OpFor it is good to snipe in the small market place near the spawning point as the crates make the player less visible. Be wary as it doesn't offer any protection as bullets will just pass through the crates, the player can then rush to the broken bus.</p>

<p>Airstrikes will never hit enemies underneath the overpass so do not place airstrikes there. This can be annoying if the player wishes to provide cover for their team trying to plant the bomb (or defuse) on Sabotage.</p>

<p>The shops near the south of the map (to the left of the Marine spawn) is the first place many players will go. The player should have teammates if going there, shotguns and SMG's are highly advised.</p>
