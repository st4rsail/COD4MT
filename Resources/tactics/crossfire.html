<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Crossfire is one of the largest maps in Call of Duty 4, with perhaps the most open buildings and places to hide. It is a favorite of snipers and campers alike. Intense sniper battles often occur between the two two-story buildings at either end of the long street. Plenty of combat also occurs in the small buildings that line the main street. Crossfire is good for Domination matches and Hardcore Team Deathmatches, as there are lots of hiding and camping spots. Assault and sniper classes work well on this map. Shotguns are also a popular choice to do the large percentage of close-range fighting. Desert camouflage is often preferred.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>The USMC  have a small advantage where their desert camo uniforms often make it hard for them to see over a long distance without a sniper or ACOG Scope.</p>

<p>An easy way to get the Counter Claymore or Counter C4 challenge is to run along the side of the map that has stairs going downward and a staircase going up leading to a room. Go down the staircase leading down and the player should see a doorway leading out side. Put a C4 on the wall and go prone somewhere secluded. When someone comes by shoot it. For a Claymore, point the Claymore away from the door way so that it doesn't just explode on its own.</p>

<p>One of the places to camp and hide would be in the building off to the side with the ladder on the side of it. Go up the ladder and into the second room, where there is a table on its side(to the right) and a couch (to the right) the player can jump back there and wait for enemy snipers for a quick and easy kill.</p>

<p>A very good and "so obvious that no one would look there" spot for snipers is at the end of the map where the OpFor spawns. There is the big sniper building where the front wall of the upstairs is all blown away, but just next to that, where all the cars are parked, there is a red car that snipers can sit behind. The player can break the driver and passenger windows by knifing them and snipe through the windows. The player is virtually invisible from across the map, and even people who run by it usually don't look there.</p>

<p>Snipers often lurk in the diner and the downhill shops</p>

<p>If enemies start to head towards the OpFor spawn point, on the left there are some bins nearby. The player can hide behind these and fire at enemies. The players are hard to spot and grenades can't reach them easily.</p>

<p>On objective based modes, it is recommended to place 3 up to 6 C4's around an objective and have a claymore stepping right in front of it so that once the person trying to get to the objective reaches it, one may activate the claymore and if that doesn't do the job, the C4's will explode and kill the enemy for sure.</p>

<p>A good tactic for if the player spawns as OpFor is to run through the diner and across the whole side of the map until he/she reaches the two story building near the Marines spawn point, climb the ladder and if the player has Dead Silence the player should be able to take out all snipers in the building. Note that most players might plant claymores at the top of the ladder.</p>

<p>The middle of the map, where the long stretch of road is notoriously known as "Broadway" because of two reasons: 1. The player will be in the middle of everything where everyone can see the player. 2. If the player decides to walk down he/she will be "lit" up with gunfire.</p>

<p>Another place to camp for people who are new is down by the green car on the other side of the bus, go prone and pick off the OpFor soldiers running from one side of the road to the other. It's good for 5-10 kills.</p>
