<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Chinatown is a remake of the popular Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2  multiplayer map Carentan for the Call of Duty 4 Variety Map Pack. Its layout is exactly the same as the original. This map's theme revolves around fighting in a heavily Chinese themed area. Almost every building in the map is open and able to be occupied. The grenade  is perfect for a mix of mid-range and close quarters combat. Many players who prefer sniping will be utterly disappointed, as there are few hiding spots and most combat will take place where a sniper rifle's advantage is diminished. It is good for almost any game mode. The central area has a basement that is frequently used. Try to stay off the streets because most players will be in the buildings around you. Due to the fact that every building is open, it is easy to get lost and, at the same time, to get spawned close to your enemies.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Try to keep inside buildings most of the time. Traveling on the streets will most likely set you up for ambushes.</p>

<p>The urban setting favors shotguns and sub-machine guns because of the constant close quarters combat in buildings. However, assault rifles such as the M4 Carbine can also be used effectively indoors.</p>

<p>Knowing the map-layout is crucial; most, if not all, of the buildings have multiple entrances. Enemy players will frequently perform flanking maneuvers.</p>

<p>When sniping, try to stay in the buildings near the edge of the map. These tend to be less accessible and have wider fields of view.</p>

<p>The mounted machine guns can provide critical suppressive fire and keep enemy players pinned down. When combined with the Deep Impact perk, the mounted machine gun is capable of piercing through buildings.</p>

<p>Many of the windows on the second floor of buildings can be climbed out of onto small ledges. Players can also jump back through the window.</p>

<p>While moving throughout the map stay close to walls and stay away from cars this will leave you less prone to attacks.</p>
