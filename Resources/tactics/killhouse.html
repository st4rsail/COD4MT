Type of Combat: Heavy close-quarters combat with some medium range fighting</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Killhouse is a very small map from the Variety Map Pack and is inspired by the tutorial level "F.N.G.". It is a symmetrical map with a looking post in the middle. The buildings are wooden and the walls are concrete. It will sure be home to some very fierce battles as the map is no larger than Shipment.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

 <p>Even though the looking post is high up, do not snipe from it. The thin plywood floor and walls can be shot through easily.</p>

<p>Close quarters combat will take the majority of kills, when running to the other team's areas use the sides, not the middle as you will most likely be killed very quickly.</p>

<p>The map is quite useful for Sub machine guns and shotguns, as they excel in close quarters.</p>

<p>Another useful strategy is to choose 3x Frag perk, Deep Impact and Sonic Boom with a shotgun, MP5, M16 or P90, its a good idea to shoot through walls, throw plenty of grenades and stay to the sides of the map.</p>

<p>A popular strategy is to use a light machine gun along with deep impact. Then, as soon as the enemy comes into the wooden corridor that is on one of the sides of the map, the player can easily kill them by shooting through the walls.</p>

<p>This map can most easily be won in a team match by strategically placing your teammates in a line position and moving through each area of the map, thereby covering all angles.</p>

<p>An M4 Carbine or G36c should do a good job here as they both have the same penetration abilities. The M4 fires about 50-100 rounds faster, but you'll only need about three rounds to kill. The G36c has better accuracy, but the M4 Carbine has an unnoticeable difference in visual recoil.</p>
