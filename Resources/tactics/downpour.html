<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Downpour is a medium-sized, narrow map that is great for run and gunning, though you always have to be careful about the two stationed machine guns at each end of the map. Downpour is a level with low visibility due to the unceasing rain.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Most Skirmishes occur around the bottleneck, silos and bush area. Usually the team that spawns on the Russian side will come down that west road or main road and camp snipers. Watch for guys climbing the side ladder of the tractor shed to get on the roof and pick people off the bottleneck area. There is a crawl space between the bush and silos but be prepared once you crawl through to shoot.</p>

<p>Another danger zone is first walking up the house ramp to the door of the house. Guys will either mount the Russian turret and just lay fire on that house since it can go through walls and the area between the house and tractor shed. Not only that, but you'll have to contend with guys in the backyard area shooting the windows if you manage to make it inside the house.</p>

<p>The teams that control the higher portion of the map (Russian spawn, Tractor Shed, House, Silos) tend to spawn camp the lower end. It is vital to control that upper area especially the turret. Helicopter barrages occur often and a fast way to take them down is to get on turret and go at it with it. The British Spawn or lower end isn't terrible either if you have dedicated turret guy and some accurate gunners. Smoke is an option as well to help move through the bottleneck.</p>
