<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Pipeline is a large multiplayer map in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Its design mainly centers around two side-to-side warehouses out in the middle of Russia and the immediate areas around it. It is an abandoned railyard with many hiding places.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>The map features a good variety of sniper positions throughout the level. Including on top of the roofs of the two main warehouses, and the green hill they both face. These positions (apart from the hill) can provide good cover from enemies who may spot the player. Almost all weapons are suited to this map, the only weapon type that struggles here are the shotguns. As they have a short range and the user will often have to neutralize targets at medium range. Then again, shotguns come in handy in the tunnels as the player will often come across enemies in close range. Try not to go straight down the middle of the map in between the two warehouses as the player face many threats such as a machine gun position and numerous other positions where the enemy can take the unfortunate player out with ease.</p>

<p>The level also has a rather elaborate network of tunnels beneath it. These tunnels can provide undetected movement from one location to another, however, they are used predominately during Search and Destroy, Headquarters and Sabotage.</p>
